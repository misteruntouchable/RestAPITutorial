# RestAPITutorial

### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

   <h> </h>
    For this Lab we are going to be coding our own Rest API using Node JS and Express. To make things simple, we are going to use the example 
    of a student going to a University and requesting academic records. The API will have four main functions. The first is going to allow 
    students to request copies of their academic records. Another fuction will be to allow people to come in and register as new students. A 
    third function will be to allow students to come in and update their information like their names (first and last). And lastly, it will 
    allow students to delete their academic records.  </b>
